/**
 * Seed script – safe to run repeatedly.
 * Each run wipes atlanta-tennis collections and rebuilds from scratch.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run seed           # normal seed
 *   npm run seed:reset     # same thing (alias)
 *
 * Produces:
 *   - 3 seasons
 *   - 5 leagues (one deliberately seeded with only 3 spots remaining)
 *   - Exactly 500 player records (populated with real Atlanta ZIPs, NTRP rating, bios)
 *   - Exactly 120 tournament-history records:
 *       • 50 Champions
 *       • 50 Finalists
 *       • 20 Semifinalists
 *   - Pre-existing registrations filling most leagues to ~60-80% capacity
